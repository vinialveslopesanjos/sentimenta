## Journey Overview

This document maps the complete user journey for SentimentIQ across six stages, from initial discovery through long-term retention and advocacy. The journey is mapped for all three personas (Marina, Ricardo, Luana) with persona-specific notes where behavior diverges significantly.

### Journey Phases at a Glance

```
DISCOVERY --> EVALUATION --> ONBOARDING --> DAILY USE --> ADVANCED USE --> RETENTION/ADVOCACY
  (Aware)     (Consider)    (Activate)    (Engage)     (Expand)        (Advocate)
```

**Average timeline:**
- Discovery to Sign-up: 3-14 days
- Sign-up to First Insight: 5-15 minutes
- First Insight to Daily Habit: 1-2 weeks
- Daily Use to Advanced Use: 2-4 weeks
- Advanced Use to Advocacy: 1-3 months

---

## Stage 1: Discovery

> "How do users first learn about SentimentIQ?"

### User Actions

| Action | Marina | Ricardo | Luana |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Search for solution | Googles "how to analyze Instagram comment sentiment" | Researches "sentiment analysis tools for agencies" | Sees recommendation in creator community |
| Encounter brand | Finds SentimentIQ in a comparison blog post or SEO result | Discovers through G2/Capterra reviews or agency toolkit article | Sees a fellow creator tweet about it or mention in a YouTube video |
| First visit | Lands on landing page from organic search | Visits pricing page first | Clicks link from social media post |
| Initial assessment | Scans features, looks for screenshots | Looks for multi-client support, pricing, integrations | Looks for simplicity, free tier, mobile screenshots |

### Touchpoints

- **Organic search (SEO)** -- Blog posts targeting keywords like "social media sentiment analysis tool," "analyze YouTube comments automatically," "Instagram comment analysis."
- **Social proof** -- Creator testimonials, agency case studies, G2/Capterra reviews.
- **Content marketing** -- Educational articles about sentiment analysis benefits, ROI calculators.
- **Word of mouth** -- Recommendations in marketing Slack communities, creator Discord servers, LinkedIn posts.
- **Comparison sites** -- Appearing in "best sentiment analysis tools" listicles on sites like G2, Capterra, and marketing blogs.
- **Social media** -- Posts by existing users sharing screenshots of their dashboards and sentiment scores.

### Emotions

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Curiosity about a potential solution | Skepticism ("another SaaS tool?") |
| Hope that this could save time | Fatigue from evaluating tools |
| Excitement about AI-powered analysis | Fear of complexity |

### Pain Points

1. Hard to find specialized sentiment tools (most search results show enterprise solutions).
2. Difficulty distinguishing between tools -- many claim to do sentiment analysis but differ vastly in depth.
3. Landing pages for competitors are often vague about what the tool actually does (Brandwatch, Emplifi require sales calls).

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **SEO strategy**: Target long-tail keywords like "free YouTube comment sentiment analyzer," "Instagram sentiment dashboard for creators," and "affordable sentiment analysis for small teams."
2. **Transparent landing page**: Show the actual product (screenshots, live demo) immediately. Do not hide behind "request a demo."
3. **Comparison content**: Create honest "SentimentIQ vs Sprout Social" and "SentimentIQ vs Brand24" pages addressing real differences.
4. **Social proof**: Display sentiment scores from real (anonymized) users on the landing page. Show the product working, not just describing it.
5. **Creator outreach**: Partner with mid-tier creators to showcase the tool organically.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Organic traffic to landing page | 5,000 monthly visits | Google Analytics |
| Landing page bounce rate | Below 55% | Google Analytics |
| Time on landing page | Above 2 minutes | Google Analytics |
| Click-through to sign-up | Above 8% | Conversion tracking |
| Source attribution | Track top 5 channels | UTM parameters |

---

## Stage 2: Evaluation

> "What makes users decide to try or skip SentimentIQ?"

### User Actions

| Action | Marina | Ricardo | Luana |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Compare options | Checks 2-3 alternatives (Brand24, basic Hootsuite) | Creates a spreadsheet comparing 5+ tools | Asks creator friends what they use |
| Check pricing | Looks for "reasonable" monthly cost (under $50) | Calculates per-client cost, needs to show value | Looks for free tier or $10-20/month plan |
| Look for proof | Reads reviews, looks for case studies | Reads G2 reviews, checks API docs | Watches demo video or sees friend's dashboard |
| Test the product | Signs up for free trial | Signs up, immediately connects 2-3 test accounts | Signs up if there is a free tier, hesitates otherwise |
| Decision trigger | "Can it generate reports I can show my boss?" | "Can it handle 10+ accounts efficiently?" | "Is it simple enough for me to use daily?" |

### Touchpoints

- **Pricing page** -- The most visited page after the landing page. Must be clear, honest, and show value per tier.
- **Feature comparison** -- Users want to know exactly what they get vs. competitors.
- **Free trial / freemium** -- The #1 factor in converting evaluators to users. No credit card required is strongly preferred.
- **Documentation / Help center** -- Ricardo will check this to evaluate technical depth.
- **Reviews (G2, Capterra)** -- Third-party validation is critical for Ricardo (agency must justify tool purchases).
- **Demo video** -- A 2-minute walkthrough showing real product usage.

### Emotions

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Optimism when features match needs | Frustration if pricing is unclear or too high |
| Relief when a free trial exists | Anxiety about data security (connecting social accounts) |
| Confidence when UI looks professional | Distrust if no reviews or social proof exist |
| Excitement seeing AI-powered features | Overwhelm if the tool looks too complex |

### Pain Points

1. **Pricing opacity**: If users cannot see pricing without a sales call (like Brandwatch), they leave immediately.
2. **Free trial anxiety**: Users worry about forgetting to cancel and being charged.
3. **Feature overload**: Too many features listed without clear "this is for you" messaging confuses users.
4. **Security concerns**: Connecting Instagram/YouTube requires trusting SentimentIQ with account access.
5. **No social proof**: Without reviews or testimonials, users default to known brands (Hootsuite, Sprout Social).

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Transparent pricing** with clear per-plan features. Show a comparison table on the pricing page itself.
2. **Free tier** with 1 connection and limited analysis (100 comments/month). Lowers the barrier to try.
3. **"No credit card required" for trial** -- removes friction.
4. **Security page** explaining exactly what data access is needed and how it is stored (encryption, GDPR compliance).
5. **Interactive product demo** or sandbox environment that works without sign-up.
6. **ROI calculator**: "How much time would you save with SentimentIQ?" based on number of accounts and comment volume.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Pricing page views | 40% of landing visitors | Analytics |
| Free trial sign-up rate | Above 15% of pricing viewers | Funnel tracking |
| Trial activation rate (connected 1 account) | Above 60% of sign-ups | Product analytics |
| Competitor comparison page engagement | Above 3 min avg. time | Analytics |
| Drop-off at registration form | Below 30% | Funnel analysis |

---

## Stage 3: Onboarding

> "The first 5 minutes determine whether a user becomes a customer or churns."

### User Flow

```
Sign Up (email or Google OAuth)
    |
    v
Welcome Screen ("Let's connect your first account!")
    |
    v
Connect Platform (YouTube handle or Instagram OAuth)
    |
    v
First Sync (scrape posts + comments)
    |
    v
Loading/Progress Indicator
    |
    v
First Dashboard (KPIs, sentiment donut, recent posts)
    |
    v
"Aha!" Moment (user sees their actual sentiment data)
```

### User Actions (Step by Step)

| Step | Action | Current State | Ideal State |
|------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Register with email+password or Google OAuth | Works well. Google OAuth reduces friction. | Add "Sign up with Google" as primary CTA for fastest onboarding. |
| 2 | Land on Dashboard (empty state) | Shows "Connect your first social network" card with CTA. | Good. Could add a progress bar ("Step 1 of 3: Connect your account"). |
| 3 | Navigate to Connect page | User clicks "Conectar rede social" button. | Smooth. Clear options for YouTube and Instagram. |
| 4 | Enter YouTube handle or authenticate Instagram | YouTube: enter channel handle. Instagram: OAuth flow. | YouTube flow is frictionless. Instagram OAuth can feel complex for non-technical users. |
| 5 | Trigger first sync | User clicks "Sync" on the connection card. | Good. Could auto-trigger first sync after connection. |
| 6 | Wait for data processing | Loading state while pipeline runs (scrape + analyze). | Add estimated time ("Analyzing 120 comments... about 2 minutes"). |
| 7 | See first results | Dashboard populates with KPIs, charts, sentiment donut. | This is the "aha!" moment. Must feel instant and impressive. |

### Emotions During Onboarding

```
Registration  -->  Connect Account  -->  First Sync  -->  See Results
   Neutral          Slight anxiety       Impatience       Excitement/Relief
   "Easy enough"    "Is this safe?"      "How long?"      "This is actually useful!"
```

### Pain Points

1. **First sync wait time** -- Depending on the volume of posts and comments, the first sync can take 1-5 minutes. Users do not know if it is working or stuck.
2. **Instagram OAuth complexity** -- Users who are not familiar with Meta Developer apps may struggle with the Instagram connection flow.
3. **No guided tour** -- After connecting, users are dropped into the dashboard without guidance on what each section means.
4. **Error states** -- If the sync fails (e.g., invalid YouTube handle, Instagram token error), the error message must be clear and actionable.
5. **"What do I do next?"** -- After seeing the first results, there is no prompt to explore specific features (comments table, health report).

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Onboarding wizard** -- A 3-step guided flow: (1) Connect, (2) Sync, (3) Explore Results.
2. **Auto-trigger first sync** -- After connecting an account, automatically start the sync instead of requiring the user to click "Sync."
3. **Progress indicator during sync** -- Show real-time progress: "Fetching posts... (15 found)" -> "Fetching comments... (234 found)" -> "Analyzing sentiment... (234/234)."
4. **Interactive tooltips** -- On first dashboard view, highlight key elements: "This is your overall sentiment score," "Click here to see trends over time."
5. **Sample data preview** -- While the first sync is running, show a demo dashboard with sample data so users understand the value immediately.
6. **Email follow-up** -- If a user signs up but does not connect an account within 24 hours, send a helpful email with a link to the connect page.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Time from sign-up to first connection | Below 3 minutes | Product analytics |
| Time from connection to first insight | Below 5 minutes | Product analytics |
| Onboarding completion rate (saw dashboard with data) | Above 70% | Funnel tracking |
| Drop-off at Instagram OAuth step | Below 25% | Step-by-step funnel |
| Users who return Day 2 after onboarding | Above 50% | Retention analysis |

---

## Stage 4: Daily Use

> "The habit loop: what brings users back every day?"

### User Actions

| Action | Frequency | Persona Focus |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Check General Dashboard | Daily (morning) | All personas |
| Review overall sentiment score | Daily | Marina, Luana |
| Check per-connection dashboard | Daily/2-3x per week | All |
| Review sentiment trend chart | 2-3x per week | Marina, Ricardo |
| Explore comments table | As needed (when score drops) | All |
| Trigger manual sync | After posting new content | Luana, Marina |
| Check pipeline logs | Occasionally (troubleshooting) | Ricardo |

### Daily Usage Patterns by Persona

**Marina (Social Media Manager):**
```
8:30 AM - Open Dashboard -> Check overall score -> Any connection in red?
8:35 AM - Click into Instagram connection -> Review sentiment trend
8:40 AM - Check top comments (negative filter) -> Flag any requiring response
8:45 AM - Done. Returns to other work.
Evening: Quick mobile check after posting new content.
```

**Ricardo (Agency Analyst):**
```
9:00 AM - Open Dashboard -> Scan all client connections for anomalies
9:10 AM - Deep-dive into Client A (connection dashboard) -> Note topics and emotions
9:20 AM - Check Client B -> Compare week-over-week sentiment
9:30 AM - Open Pipeline Logs -> Verify all syncs ran successfully overnight
```

**Luana (Content Creator):**
```
9:00 AM - Open app on phone -> See overall sentiment score
9:02 AM - Check latest video's sentiment -> "How did people react?"
9:05 AM - Filter comments to "positive" -> Read a few uplifting ones
Afternoon: After posting new Reel -> Trigger sync -> Check results in 5 min
```

### Touchpoints

- **General Dashboard** -- The home screen and daily starting point.
- **Connection Dashboard** -- The deep-dive per platform/account.
- **Sentiment Trend Chart** -- The visual that tells the story over time.
- **Comments Table** -- The searchable, filterable comment explorer.
- **Sync Button** -- Manual trigger for fresh data.
- **AI Health Report** -- Weekly/bi-weekly use for reports and strategy.

### Emotions

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Confidence when score is high | Anxiety when score drops suddenly |
| Satisfaction from data-driven decisions | Frustration if data is stale (sync not recent) |
| Delight when AI report saves reporting time | Confusion if chart data does not match expectations |
| Pride showing sentiment data to stakeholders | Impatience waiting for sync to complete |

### Pain Points

1. **Data freshness** -- If sync runs only on manual trigger, data can be hours or days old. Users expect near-real-time data.
2. **Dashboard loading time** -- With large datasets, the dashboard may take seconds to load. Any delay above 3 seconds feels slow.
3. **Limited date range control** -- The granularity selector (day/week/month) exists but there is no date picker for custom ranges.
4. **No notifications** -- Users have to manually check the dashboard. No alerts for significant sentiment changes.
5. **Mobile experience** -- The sidebar navigation may not be optimal on mobile screens.
6. **Lack of comparison** -- Cannot compare two connections side-by-side (e.g., YouTube vs Instagram performance).

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Automated scheduled syncs** -- Daily or hourly automatic sync so data is always fresh without user intervention.
2. **Push notifications / email alerts** -- "Your sentiment score dropped 15% today" or "Unusual negative spike detected on Instagram."
3. **Custom date range picker** -- Allow users to select specific date ranges, not just "last 90 days."
4. **Dashboard performance optimization** -- Lazy loading, caching, skeleton states (already partially implemented).
5. **Mobile-optimized layout** -- Collapsible sidebar, stacked cards, swipeable charts.
6. **Comparison view** -- Side-by-side connection comparison for users with multiple accounts.
7. **Daily digest email** -- Automatic morning summary: "Here's how your sentiment looked yesterday."

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Daily Active Users (DAU) | Track growth rate | Product analytics |
| Sessions per user per week | Above 4 | Product analytics |
| Average session duration | 3-8 minutes | Product analytics |
| Most used features (ranked) | Track top 5 | Click/page analytics |
| Dashboard load time | Below 2 seconds | Performance monitoring |
| Sync frequency per user | 1-3x daily | Product analytics |

---

### Advanced Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Campaign Impact Analysis (Marina)**
```
1. Note the campaign start date
2. Go to Connection Dashboard -> Sentiment Trend
3. Set granularity to "day" and look at the period around the campaign
4. Compare sentiment before, during, and after
5. Check Topics Chart to see if campaign messaging appeared in audience discussions
6. Generate AI Health Report to summarize findings
7. Copy key data points into management presentation
```

**Scenario 2: Monthly Client Reporting (Ricardo)**
```
1. For each client (connection):
   a. Open Connection Dashboard
   b. Set trend view to last 30 days
   c. Note: avg score, sentiment distribution, top emotions, top topics
   d. Generate AI Health Report
   e. Export key metrics for inclusion in client report
2. Compare month-over-month across all clients
3. Identify best and worst performing clients
4. Compile into agency-wide monthly summary
```

**Scenario 3: Content Strategy Optimization (Luana)**
```
1. Open Connection Dashboard for YouTube
2. Look at individual posts and their sentiment scores
3. Identify: which video topics generate the most positive sentiment?
4. Cross-reference with Emotion Chart: do tutorials generate more "admiration"?
5. Check Topics Chart: what are people talking about most?
6. Plan next month's content based on positive-sentiment topics
```

### Touchpoints

- **All Daily Use touchpoints** plus:
- **Pipeline Logs page** -- Monitoring sync health and troubleshooting errors.
- **Post Detail page** -- Per-post sentiment breakdown with comment analysis.
- **Emotion and Topics Charts** -- Deep analytical views per connection.
- **AI Health Report** -- The premium analytical feature.

### Emotions

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Mastery and expertise feeling | Frustration if features are limited compared to needs |
| Power from having data others do not | Disappointment if AI report is repetitive or generic |
| Strategic confidence in decisions | Impatience with manual processes (no auto-export, no scheduling) |
| Professional pride in report quality | Overwhelm if managing too many connections without workspace organization |

### Pain Points

1. **No export/PDF** -- Users want to export reports and charts for presentations. Currently, there is no export feature.
2. **AI Health Report lacks customization** -- The report is one-size-fits-all. Advanced users want to customize what it covers.
3. **No workspace or folder organization** -- Ricardo managing 10+ clients has no way to organize connections into groups.
4. **No automated reporting schedule** -- Monthly reports must be generated manually each time.
5. **Limited historical data** -- If the tool only stores data from the sync date forward, users cannot analyze historical periods.
6. **No cross-connection analytics** -- Cannot aggregate or compare data across multiple connections in a single view.

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Report export (PDF/PNG)** -- Allow exporting dashboards, charts, and AI reports as professional PDFs or image files.
2. **Workspace / client groups** -- Let agency users organize connections into client folders.
3. **Scheduled reports** -- Automated weekly/monthly reports sent via email.
4. **Custom AI report prompts** -- Let users customize what the AI Health Report focuses on.
5. **Cross-connection comparison dashboard** -- Compare 2-3 connections side by side.
6. **Data retention and backfill** -- Show data history from the moment of connection, and where possible, backfill historical data.
7. **Webhooks / API access** -- For Ricardo's integration needs with external tools.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Connections per user | Above 2 (power users: 5+) | Product analytics |
| AI Health Report generation rate | 2+ per user per month | Feature usage |
| Feature adoption depth | 60%+ use 4+ features | Feature tracking |
| Pipeline Logs page visits | Track for power user identification | Page analytics |
| Comment search usage | Track query volume | Feature analytics |
| Time spent per session (power users) | 10-20 minutes | Session tracking |

---

## Stage 6: Retention and Advocacy

> "What keeps users paying, and what makes them recommend SentimentIQ?"

### Retention Drivers

| Driver | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Habit formation** | Daily dashboard check becomes automatic | High |
| **Data accumulation** | The longer users stay, the more historical data they have, making the tool more valuable over time | Very High |
| **Time savings** | Quantifiable hours saved per week vs manual analysis | High |
| **Unique insights** | AI-powered analysis they cannot get from platform-native tools | High |
| **Switching cost** | Historical data and configured connections make switching painful | Medium |
| **Report dependency** | Stakeholders (managers, clients) expect the sentiment data in regular reports | Very High |

### Churn Risks

| Risk | Trigger | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Price sensitivity** | User finds a cheaper alternative or hits budget limits | Offer annual discount, downgrade option, or "pause" instead of cancel |
| **Feature stagnation** | Tool does not evolve; competitors add features | Regular feature releases, public roadmap, changelog |
| **Data quality issues** | Sentiment analysis feels inaccurate or inconsistent | Continuously improve AI model, allow user feedback on sentiment accuracy |
| **Technical problems** | Sync failures, API errors, slow performance | Robust error handling, status page, proactive communication |
| **Competitor poaching** | A competitor offers a better deal or feature | Differentiate on AI quality, UX simplicity, and niche focus |
| **Outgrown the tool** | Power users need features SentimentIQ does not offer yet | Build API access and integrations to extend capabilities |

### Advocacy Triggers

| Trigger | Channel | Persona |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Tool saves significant time | Recommends to colleagues/friends | Marina |
| Client praises the sentiment data in a report | Mentions tool to other agencies | Ricardo |
| Positive ROI on brand deals using sentiment data | Posts about it on social media | Luana |
| Delightful UX moment | Shares screenshot on Twitter/LinkedIn | All |
| Exceptional support experience | Writes a positive review on G2 | Ricardo |
| Feature request gets implemented | Tells peers the team listens | All |

### Actions to Drive Advocacy

1. **Referral program** -- "Invite a friend, both get 1 month free" or "Refer a client, get a discount."
2. **Social sharing** -- Easy "Share my sentiment score" button that generates a branded image for social media.
3. **Public roadmap** -- Show what features are coming; let users vote. Builds community and loyalty.
4. **User community** -- Discord server or community forum where users share strategies and tips.
5. **Case study program** -- Feature successful users in blog posts and on the landing page (with their permission).
6. **NPS surveys** -- Quarterly surveys to identify promoters and detractors early.
7. **Milestone celebrations** -- "You have analyzed 10,000 comments!" -- gamification elements.

### Emotions

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Loyalty and brand affinity | Frustration if a feature request is ignored |
| Pride in recommending a good tool | Guilt if the tool is expensive and underused |
| Sense of community with other users | Resignation if the tool stagnates |

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Monthly retention rate | Above 90% | Subscription analytics |
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | Above 40 | Quarterly survey |
| Referral conversion rate | Above 10% | Referral tracking |
| G2/Capterra review count | 50+ reviews in Year 1 | Review monitoring |
| Social media mentions | Track growth | Social listening (dogfooding!) |
| Expansion revenue (upgrades) | 20%+ of revenue | Subscription analytics |

## Journey Summary Table

| Stage | Duration | Key Action | Emotion Peak | Biggest Risk | Top Opportunity |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Days 1-14 | Find SentimentIQ | Curiosity | Not found / lost in noise | SEO + creator partnerships |
| Evaluation | Days 3-14 | Compare and decide | Hope/Skepticism | Price shock / no free tier | Transparent pricing + free trial |

| Retention | Month 1+ | Continued use + referral | Loyalty | Churn triggers | Referral program + community |

---

## Critical Moments of Truth

These are the make-or-break moments that determine user success:

### Moment 1: "Can I See Pricing Without a Sales Call?"
- **When**: Evaluation stage
- **Impact**: If pricing is hidden, 70%+ of prospects leave
- **Action**: Always show transparent pricing

### Moment 2: "How Long Until I See My First Sentiment Data?"
- **When**: Onboarding (first 5 minutes)
- **Impact**: If time-to-first-insight exceeds 10 minutes, activation drops sharply
- **Action**: Optimize first sync speed, show progress, provide sample data while waiting

### Moment 3: "Is This Data Actually Accurate?"
- **When**: Early Daily Use (first week)
- **Impact**: If users spot sentiment misclassifications, trust erodes fast
- **Action**: Invest in AI quality, allow user feedback, explain confidence scores

### Moment 4: "Can I Use This Data in My Report?"
- **When**: Advanced Use
- **Impact**: If data cannot be exported or shared, the tool becomes isolated
- **Action**: Build export features (PDF, PNG, CSV) and shareable links

### Moment 5: "Is This Still Worth Paying For?"
- **When**: End of free trial or after 3 months
- **Impact**: The renewal decision -- most churn happens here
- **Action**: Ensure clear ROI demonstrated before renewal, send "your impact" summary
