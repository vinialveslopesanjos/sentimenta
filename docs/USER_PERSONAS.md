## Persona 1: Marina - Social Media Manager

### Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Marina Oliveira |
| **Age** | 28 |
| **Location** | Sao Paulo, Brazil |
| **Education** | Bachelor's in Communications / Marketing |
| **Role** | Social Media Manager at a mid-size consumer brand |
| **Experience** | 4 years in social media management |
| **Income** | R$5,000-8,000/month (mid-level professional) |
| **Device** | MacBook Air (work), iPhone 15 (personal) |

### Background

Marina manages 3-5 social media accounts for a consumer brand in the fashion/lifestyle space. She reports directly to the Marketing Director and is responsible for content strategy, community management, and monthly performance reports. She works in a small marketing team (4 people) and wears many hats -- sometimes she is the strategist, sometimes the community manager, sometimes the analyst.

### Quote

> "I spend two hours every morning reading through comments just to get a sense of how people feel about our latest campaign. There has to be a better way."

### Goals and Motivations

1. **Save time on manual comment analysis** -- Marina currently reads hundreds of comments daily across platforms to gauge audience sentiment. Automating this would free up 8-10 hours per week.
2. **Data-driven reporting** -- She wants to present quantitative sentiment data (not just engagement metrics) to her manager to justify campaign decisions and budget.
3. **Early crisis detection** -- After a PR incident where negative comments snowballed before anyone noticed, Marina wants real-time alerts when sentiment shifts suddenly.
4. **Impress management** -- Professional reports with AI-generated insights would position her as a data-driven professional and help her case for promotion.
5. **Understand content performance beyond vanity metrics** -- Likes and views do not tell the whole story; sentiment tells her whether people genuinely love or hate the content.

### Frustrations and Pain Points

1. **Comment overload** -- With 3-5 accounts, each getting 50-200 comments per post, manually reading everything is unsustainable.
2. **Subjectivity in reporting** -- When she tells her boss "the audience seems positive," there is no data backing the claim. She needs numbers.
3. **Tool fatigue** -- She already uses Canva, Meta Business Suite, Hootsuite, and Google Analytics. Adding another complex tool feels overwhelming.
4. **Instagram API limitations** -- She has tried other tools that promise Instagram analysis but they often fail or provide incomplete data.
5. **Budget constraints** -- Tools like Sprout Social ($199+/user/month) are too expensive for a mid-size brand. She needs to justify every subscription.
6. **No unified view** -- She manages YouTube and Instagram separately and has no single place to see sentiment across both platforms.

## Persona 2: Ricardo - Digital Agency Analyst

### Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Ricardo Mendes |
| **Age** | 32 |
| **Location** | Lisbon, Portugal |
| **Education** | Master's in Digital Marketing |
| **Role** | Senior Digital Analyst at a mid-size digital agency |
| **Experience** | 7 years in digital marketing, 4 at agencies |
| **Income** | EUR 3,500-5,000/month |
| **Device** | ThinkPad (work), dual monitors, Pixel 8 (personal) |

### Background

Ricardo works at a digital marketing agency that manages social media for 10-15 clients across various industries (food, tech startups, retail, tourism). He is the "data guy" -- responsible for analytics, reporting, and strategic recommendations. He works with 3 community managers and reports to the agency's Head of Social. Each month, he produces detailed reports for each client showing campaign performance, audience insights, and strategic recommendations.

### Quote

> "My clients don't care about impressions. They want to know: 'Are people talking positively about my brand, and what are they saying?' I need a tool that answers that at scale."

### Goals and Motivations

1. **Multi-client efficiency** -- Managing 10+ accounts means he needs a tool that lets him switch between clients in seconds, not minutes.
2. **Professional client reports** -- Clients pay premium rates; they expect premium deliverables. Sentiment data adds a layer of sophistication to reports.
3. **Competitive advantage** -- Most agencies offer basic metrics. Offering AI-powered sentiment analysis differentiates his agency.
4. **Scalability** -- As the agency grows, he needs tools that scale without proportionally increasing his workload.
5. **Data export and integration** -- He works with Google Data Studio, Tableau, and custom dashboards. Data needs to flow between systems.

### Frustrations and Pain Points

1. **Tool switching** -- Currently uses 4-5 different tools for different clients/platforms. Consolidation would save hours weekly.
2. **No unified sentiment view** -- Each tool does sentiment differently. Scores are not comparable across platforms.
3. **Enterprise pricing** -- Brandwatch and Sprout Social enterprise tiers cost $1,000+/month. Hard to justify for mid-size agencies.
4. **Report generation** -- Creating 10+ monthly reports manually takes 3-4 days. Any automation is valuable.
5. **Client education** -- Clients often do not understand sentiment metrics. He needs clear, visual data that tells a story.
6. **Historical data limitations** -- Some tools only retain 30-60 days of data. He needs 6-12 months for trend analysis.
7. **API rate limits** -- When scraping data for multiple clients, he often hits platform API limits.

### A Day in His Life

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 9:00 AM | Review overnight alerts and notifications across client accounts |
| 9:30 AM | Team standup -- discusses client priorities for the day |
| 10:00 AM | Deep-dive into analytics for Client A's monthly report |
| 11:00 AM | Pull sentiment data and compile insights for Client B's campaign review |
| 12:00 PM | Client call -- present last month's performance and recommendations |
| 1:00 PM | Lunch |

| 4:00 PM | Review community managers' flagged comments for urgent client issues |
| 5:00 PM | Strategic planning session with Head of Social |
| 5:30 PM | Prepare next day's priorities and queue reports |

### How Ricardo Would Use SentimentIQ

1. **Client overview (daily)** -- Checks the General Dashboard to see aggregate health across all connected accounts, spotting any clients with declining scores.
2. **Per-client deep dive (as needed)** -- Navigates to each client's Connection Dashboard for detailed emotion, topic, and trend analysis.
3. **Monthly report generation** -- Uses AI Health Reports and trend data to compile the sentiment section of client monthly reports.
4. **Campaign analysis** -- Compares sentiment trends before, during, and after campaigns using the granularity selector (day/week/month).
5. **Topic mining** -- Uses the Topics Chart to identify emerging themes in client audiences, informing content strategy.
6. **Pipeline monitoring** -- Checks Pipeline Logs to ensure data sync is running smoothly across all client accounts.

### Feature Priorities

|----------|---------|--------|

## Persona 3: Luana - Content Creator / Influencer

### Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Luana Santos |
| **Age** | 24 |
| **Location** | Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |
| **Education** | Bachelor's in Design (incomplete, dropped out to pursue content) |
| **Role** | Independent Content Creator / Influencer (beauty, lifestyle) |
| **Experience** | 3 years creating content full-time |
| **Income** | R$8,000-15,000/month (variable, brand deals + ads) |
| **Device** | iPhone 15 Pro (primary), iPad Air, MacBook (occasional editing) |
| **Followers** | 250K Instagram, 180K YouTube |

### Background

Luana started posting beauty tutorials on YouTube 4 years ago and grew her audience organically. She now creates content full-time across YouTube and Instagram, earning through brand partnerships, YouTube AdSense, and Instagram collaborations. She manages everything herself -- content creation, editing, posting, community engagement, and business negotiations. She recently started feeling overwhelmed by the volume of comments and the emotional toll of reading negative feedback.

### Quote

> "I love my community, but reading 500 comments per video is exhausting. And the hateful ones stick with me all day. I wish I could see how my audience REALLY feels without drowning in every single comment."

### Goals and Motivations

1. **Understand what content resonates** -- She wants data on which types of content generate the most positive reactions, not just the most views.
2. **Filter negativity** -- She wants to focus on constructive feedback and avoid the emotional impact of reading every hateful comment.
3. **Content strategy optimization** -- Using sentiment trends to plan what to create next (topics that drive positive engagement).
4. **Brand deal justification** -- Brands increasingly ask for engagement quality, not just quantity. Sentiment data helps justify higher rates.
5. **Mental health** -- Having a buffer between raw comments and her analysis protects her well-being while staying informed.
6. **Audience growth** -- Understanding audience emotions helps her create more resonant content and grow faster.

### Frustrations and Pain Points

1. **Comment volume** -- With 200-500 comments per video/post, reading everything is impossible and emotionally draining.
2. **Platform analytics are shallow** -- YouTube Studio and Instagram Insights show likes and views but say nothing about sentiment.
3. **Emotional vulnerability** -- As a creator, negative comments feel personal. She avoids reading comments some days, which means missing important feedback.
4. **No affordable tools** -- Most sentiment analysis tools are designed for brands/agencies and cost $100+/month. That is too much for an individual.
5. **Mobile-first workflow** -- She does 80% of her social media work from her phone. Desktop-only tools do not fit her workflow.
6. **Technical complexity** -- She is not a data analyst. She needs insights presented simply, not raw data she has to interpret.
7. **Multi-platform fragmentation** -- She posts on both YouTube and Instagram but has no unified view of her audience sentiment.

### A Day in Her Life

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 9:00 AM | Wakes up, checks Instagram Stories analytics and DMs from phone |
| 10:00 AM | Reads through top YouTube comments on latest video (phone) |
| 11:00 AM | Films content (1-2 videos/reels) |
| 1:00 PM | Lunch, scrolls through comment section on Instagram posts |
| 2:00 PM | Edits video on MacBook |
| 4:00 PM | Posts Instagram Reel, engages with comments for 30 min |
| 5:00 PM | Reviews brand deal proposals, checks engagement stats |
| 6:00 PM | Plans next week's content based on what performed well |
| 8:00 PM | Posts YouTube video, monitors initial comments from phone |
| 10:00 PM | Final comment check before bed (admits this affects sleep quality) |

### How Luana Would Use SentimentIQ

1. **Morning mood check (2 min, from phone)** -- Glances at the General Dashboard to see her overall sentiment score. Green = good day. Red = investigate.
2. **Content performance analysis (weekly)** -- Checks which posts have the highest sentiment scores (not just most likes) to inform future content.
3. **Emotion analysis** -- Uses the Emotion Chart to understand if her audience feels joy, surprise, admiration -- helping her tailor content tone.
4. **Topic trends** -- Uses the Topics Chart to see what her audience is discussing most, informing content ideas.
5. **Selective comment reading** -- Uses the Comment Explorer filtered to "positive" to boost her mood, and occasionally checks "negative" with the AI summary so she gets the gist without reading raw hate.
6. **Brand pitch prep** -- Before negotiating deals, pulls up her AI Health Report to show brands her audience sentiment quality.

### Feature Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Must-have** | Simple dashboard with overall score | Quick daily check |
| **Must-have** | Sentiment filtering on comments | Avoid negativity, find constructive feedback |
| **Must-have** | Mobile-responsive design | She works from her phone |
| **Must-have** | YouTube + Instagram in one place | Both platforms matter |
| **Nice-to-have** | Emotion breakdown per post | Understand audience feelings deeply |
| **Nice-to-have** | AI-generated content suggestions | "Your audience loved X topics" |
| **Nice-to-have** | Shareable sentiment report for brands | Justify higher rates |
| **Nice-to-have** | Notification for unusual sentiment drops | Catch issues early |
| **Low priority** | API access | Not technical |
| **Low priority** | Multi-account management | Solo creator |

## Key Takeaways for Product Development

### The 3 Biggest Pain Points Across All Personas

1. **Comment overload and manual analysis** -- All three personas struggle with the sheer volume of comments and the time required to read/categorize them. This is SentimentIQ's core value proposition.

2. **Lack of quantitative sentiment data** -- Platform-native analytics (YouTube Studio, Instagram Insights) provide engagement metrics but zero sentiment information. Users cannot answer "How does my audience FEEL?" with existing tools.

3. **Expensive or overly complex existing solutions** -- Enterprise tools (Sprout Social, Brandwatch) cost $200-$1,000+/month and are designed for large teams. There is a gap for an affordable, focused sentiment analysis tool that serves individuals and small teams.

### Design Implications

- **Simplicity first**: The UI must deliver value within 30 seconds of loading. Lead with the sentiment score and trend, not with settings or configuration.
- **Mobile responsiveness is not optional**: Luana represents a growing segment of users who work primarily from mobile. The dashboard must be fully functional on phones.
- **Tiered pricing**: The personas span from R$30/month (Luana) to EUR 500/month (Ricardo's agency). A freemium or tiered model is essential to capture all segments.
- **AI-powered insights over raw data**: All personas want summaries and recommendations, not raw CSV exports. The AI Health Report is a key differentiator -- invest in making it excellent.
- **Fast onboarding**: First value must come within 5 minutes of sign-up. Connect account, trigger sync, see first insights.
