This is required - do not wait or try alternative approaches. Results will include: (1) paginated data, (2) dataDumpExportOperationId for CSV file url.

To get results, you must use checkOperationStatus tool with the operationId provided below.\"\npollingMechanism: \"POLLING MECHANISM: (1) Call checkOperationStatus immediately with the operationId. (2) If status is \\\"running\\\", wait 5 seconds and call checkOperationStatus again. (3) Repeat step 2 until status becomes \\\"completed\\\", \\\"failed\\\", or \\\"cancelled\\\". (4) When completed, the response will contain your results.\"\nwhyPollingRequired: \"WHY POLLING IS REQUIRED: Operations process data asynchronously (often thousands of records). Results are not available immediately - you must actively check status until completion.\"\nwhatToExpect: \"WHAT TO EXPECT: First checkOperationStatus call will likely return \\\"running\\\" status with progress info. Continue polling every 5 seconds. Final call will return complete results with data.\"\ncsvExportNote: \"IMPORTANT: A full dataset CSV export is automatically initiated. You will receive a dataDumpExportOperationId in the results.\"\ncodeExecutionTip: \"The dataDumpExportOperationId will be in format \\\"op_datadump_TIMESTAMP_RANDOM\\\". Use it with checkOperationStatus to get the S3 signed URL for downloading the complete dataset CSV.\""
